# Kneepo Has Fallen
A burnt room, scorched floors and walls, houses an iron cage.  In the corner there is a carving showing that [[Kneepo the Slim]] may have been a prisoner here.

# The Walls Attack
After investigating some glowing runes on the wall, a spear juts out of the runes and the fight is on.  Hubert was pulled across the room by [[Talon]]'s [[telekinetic-hand-pc1|Telekinetic Hand]].

# Lost in the Woods
[[Talon]] had a dream and awoke with an awakened power. [[Maialen]] can feel something and we may have a direction to travel.  She senses a thread.  Following the thread we find an archway surrounded in carved megafauna.

# Through the Gateway
We step through the gateway and are in a verdant jungle, we can once again detect which way is north.  We have ended up in the [[Mwangi Expanse]].
