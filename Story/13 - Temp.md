# Fighting
We are fighting another one of those owl things that make us move in the wrong directions.

Things went poorly, [[Rhodd]] couldn't get to the creature to fight, [[Maialen]] and [[J Seeral]] went down.  [[Darak]] ended up taking the creature down.  After [[Rhodd]] administered a healing potion to [[J Seeral]] we were able to get everyone back on their feet.

We failed to be able to identify a substance we've been carrying with us.  For some reason we seem to be able to manipulate where we are without physically moving.

I accidently said [[Kneepo the Slim]] and saw a strange slim creature in the woods.
