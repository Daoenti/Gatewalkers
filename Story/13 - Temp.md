# Fighting
We are fighting another one of those owl things that make us move in the wrong directions.

Things went poorly, [[Rhodd]] couldn't get to the creature to fight, [[Maialen]] and [[J Seeral]] went down.  [[Darak]] ended up taking the creature down.  After [[Rhodd]] administered a healing potion to [[J Seeral]] we were able to get everyone back on their feet.

# After the fight
We failed to be able to identify a substance we've been carrying with us.  For some reason we seem to be able to manipulate where we are without physically moving.

I accidently said [[Kneepo the Slim]] and saw a strange slim creature in the woods.

We see creatures in the woods, with evil eyes.  We move back without getting so far away from the door, we keep it in our eyesight.

# The Door
As we move around to the side of the door we notice the light keeps facing us, like the light is an anchor point.  While we don't see any traps, we do hear a chuckling sound coming from the other side of the door.

# Beyond the door
No natural light, however everything is dimly lit.  The room we see in front of us is a strange temple.  The silhouette we've been seeing in the trees appears in front of us. I see a moving shadow on the back wall.
