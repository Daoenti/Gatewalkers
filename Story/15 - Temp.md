# The Bed Beyond the Library
A painting depicting two slender black and white creatures adorns the wall behind a bed.  One figure appears to be [[Kneepo the Slim]] but the other creature seems to look slightly different.  The second figure looks strangely like [[Maialen]].  When covering it's eyes she felt a connection to the painting.  [[Maialen]] cut her likeness out of the painting, but when cutting it out the eyes on the representation of [[Kneepo the Slim]] blinked...

I looked under the bed, something flittered.  A lone tooth fairy flew out, giving it an offering of the gold molar we found earlier he traded me the tooth he had, a [[bloodseeker-beak|Bloodseeker Beak]].

# The Shadow Lady
A shadowy visage of a lady wearing a white suit stained in blood appears and is instantly aggressive toward [[Maialen]].  She is jealous of [[Maialen]], perhaps [[Kneepo the Slim]] wants [[Maialen]] for a bride.
