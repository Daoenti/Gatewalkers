# The bed beyond the library
A painting depicting two slender black and white creatures adorns the wall behind a bed.  One figure appears to be [[Kneepo the Slim]] but the other creature seems to look slightly different.  The second figure looks strangely like [[Maialen]].  When covering it's eyes she felt a connection to the painting.
