# The Tooth Fairy Nightmare
The room we entered had smiling teeth staring back at us... [[Tooth Fairy Swarm]]

# The Centaur Druid
"How dare you enter [[Kneepo the Slim]]'s Court".  

# The Dining Room
Elven skulls surround the walls, strange glowing worms are crawling through out them.  After reaching in one of the worms popped and made [[J Seeral]] sick.  A small larder is in the south east corner containing slabs of unidentifiable meat.
