# Attack from the Sky
While riding the gondola we were attacked by two Pteranodons. I went off the edge.

# The Three Eyed Elf
![[Pasted image 20240430211729.png|left|200]]A gem in the 'third eye' position makes it seem like the elf in front of us has three eyes.  Talking to Lilly she shows us a telescope and upon looking through it we see the world we are from.  We are no longer on Golarian.  Upon talking to Lilly more we found we are on Castrabel, the second planet in the solar system.
