# Attack from the Sky
While riding the gondola we were attacked by two Pteranodons. I went off the edge.

# The Three Eyed Elf
![[Pasted image 20240430211729.png|left|200]]A gem in the 'third eye' position makes it seem like the elf in front of us has three eyes.  Talking to Alleli she shows us a telescope and upon looking through it we see the world we are from.  We were not in the [[Mwangi Expanse]] and in fact are no longer on Golarian.  Upon talking to Alleli more we found we are on Castrovel, the second planet in the solar system. We are currently in the jungle continent of Ukulam, in the settlement of Loskialua. A woman from Golarian made a transmission to the elves on Castrovel.
