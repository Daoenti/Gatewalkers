# The Bed Beyond the Library
A painting depicting two slender black and white creatures adorns the wall behind a comfortable looking bed.  One figure appears to be [[Kneepo the Slim]] but the other creature seems to look similar but with slightly different features.  After closer examination it was noticed that the second figure has features strangely like [[Maialen]]'s.  [[J Seeral]] attempted the same test we had used before, and covering the painting representation of her eyes caused her to feel a connection to the painting.  [[Maialen]] cut her likeness out of the painting, but when cutting it out, the eyes on the representation of [[Kneepo the Slim]] blinked. [[Rhodd]] flipped a table.

[[J Seeral]] looked under the bed, something flittered.  A lone tooth fairy flew out, giving it an offering of the gold molar we found earlier he traded me the tooth he had, a [[bloodseeker-beak|Bloodseeker Beak]].

# The Shadow Lady
A shadowy visage of a lady wearing a mask and a white suit stained in blood appeared and is instantly aggressive toward [[Maialen]].  She is viciously jealous of [[Maialen]], perhaps [[Kneepo the Slim]] wants [[Maialen]] for a bride.  We learn that she is a type of fae called a [[Shae]].  She eventually succumbed to us after nearly killing [[Maialen]].

# The Amber Tree
![[Pasted image 20240409191417.png]] [[The Looksee Man]] attacked us, saying that it's not finished yet and we are too early.  Two large amber colored "reproduction" pods are in the tree. [[Maialen]] attacked one of the reproduction pods which sent [[The Looksee Man]] into a rampage.  After seeing the reaction [[J Seeral]] moved in and said he would destroy the other pod if [[The Looksee Man]] wouldn't stop and answer our questions.  Eventually we all agreed to lay down our weapons and have a discussion about what was exactly going on here.  During the discussions we found that the pods were being used to transfer the traits of one thing to another thing.  [[The Looksee Man]] doesn't know the limits of it yet but he knows it's not stable and not ready to be used outside of his experimentation to make it stable, however he did show us a bunny and a frog that he transposed the features of, the bunny having a frog like tongue and the frog having long bunny ears.
