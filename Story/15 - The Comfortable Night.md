# The Bed Beyond the Library
A painting depicting two slender black and white creatures adorns the wall behind a bed.  One figure appears to be [[Kneepo the Slim]] but the other creature seems to look slightly different.  The second figure looks strangely like [[Maialen]].  When covering it's eyes she felt a connection to the painting.  [[Maialen]] cut her likeness out of the painting, but when cutting it out the eyes on the representation of [[Kneepo the Slim]] blinked...

I looked under the bed, something flittered.  A lone tooth fairy flew out, giving it an offering of the gold molar we found earlier he traded me the tooth he had, a [[bloodseeker-beak|Bloodseeker Beak]].

# The Shadow Lady
A shadowy visage of a lady wearing a mask and a white suit stained in blood appeared and is instantly aggressive toward [[Maialen]].  She is viciously jealous of [[Maialen]], perhaps [[Kneepo the Slim]] wants [[Maialen]] for a bride.  We learn that she is a type of fae called a [[Shae]].

# The Amber Tree
![[Pasted image 20240402211314.png|inlL|150]][[The Looksee Man]] attacked us, saying that it's not finished yet and we are too early.  Two large amber colored "reproduction" pods are in the tree. [[Maialen]]threatened one of the reproduction pods which sent [[The Looksee Man]] into a rampage.  After [[J Seeral]] said he would destroy the other pod if [[The Looksee Man]] wouldn't stop and answer our questions.  During the discussions we found that the pods were being used to transfer the traits of one thing to another thing.  [[The Looksee Man]] doesn't know the limits of it yet but he knows it's not stable and not ready to be used, however he did show us a bunny and a frog that he transposed the features of, the bunny having a frog like tongue and the frog having long bunny ears.
