# Attack of the Poo Flinging Monkey Thing
We swiftly finish off the monkey thing.

# The Killer Snail and Friends
After seeing stepping stones crossing the river [[J Seeral]] noticed one of the stones didn't look quite right.  After chucking a rock at the odd looking stone we noticed it was the shell of a very large snail.  [[Rhodd]] slipped off the rocks but caught himself before being washed down river.  [[Maialen]] was knocked out but luckily managed to stay on the rock when she fell. After an intense fight it finally fled down river.

# The Elf Head
Two Desa-Desa crawl out of a giant statue of an elf's head and proceed to attack us.  This head statue is of an ancient art style, however it doesn't look ancient.
