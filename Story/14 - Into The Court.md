# The Tooth Fairy Nightmare
Small winged fae fly out of holes in the walls, before we know it we are face to face with a [[Tooth Fairy Swarm]].  After an expertly placed dagger by [[Darak]] and a [[concordant-choir-som|Concordant Choir]] by [[J Seeral]] the swarm was eliminated.

# The Centaur Druid
"How dare you enter [[Kneepo the Slim]]'s Court".  The centaur and [[Metal Eyeball]] attacked, doing a ton of bleeding damage as they rushed through the room hitting everyone and everything.  A long fight ensued where they were both finally brought down.  Unfortunately the centaur's gear was too large for any of us to use and had to be left behind.

# The Dining Room
Elven skulls surround the walls, strange glowing worms are crawling through out them.  After reaching in one of the worms popped and made [[J Seeral]] sick.  A small larder is in the south east corner containing slabs of unidentifiable meat.  After exploring the larder [[Darak]] noted that the meat here is likely from humanoid sources.  A furnace glows in the corner.

# The Painted Walls
Paintings of [[Kneepo the Slim]] kneeling before [[Count Renalc]].  War with elves, the beginning of the Enubliet Curse.  The paintings are magically enchanted.
