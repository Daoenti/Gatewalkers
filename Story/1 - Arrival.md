# The Enubliet Curse
The curse in the [[Sevenarches]] area is known for killing elves, however the area is strangely not being affected by it currently.

So... after we reached Sevenarches we were sent to investigate the aiudara in Sevenarches itself. We found they were fake. After a scuffle with the local Oak Stewards we made it out and were then sent south (?) to see if we could find the real aiudara and a rogue Oak Steward named Bolan who was in posession of an object called the Shade Wither Key. We get to the real aiudara and stop the splinter Oak Stewards from sacraficing a unicorn. We then traveled further and ended up at Greenleaf, a gnome settlement that had been taken over by the rogue Oak Stewards, who were using it to grow their plants to make their poisons, all while using the gnome population there as test subjects. We, uh, handled that situation, killed Bolan, found that the Shade Wither Key was given to Kneepo the Slim. We returned to Sevenarches, made nice with the Oak Stewards that we scuffled with earlier, researched and talked to people until we found references to a place known as the Thin Lands, a farm outside of Sevenarches (the town, not the country). After getting to the Farm some stuff happened (I can't remember all what, sorry) but then we ended up coming across into the First World where my notes above pick up.
